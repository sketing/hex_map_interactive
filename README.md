# Interaractive Hex Map
This is a project for a browser based tool for Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) enthusiasts, DMs and players alike
The plan is to create a tool, where the DM could generate, edit and populate a hexagonal map and then possibily share it with players and other DMs

## Planned features:
**High priority** features:
1) select a map/canvas size
2) edit and select a tile type (moutain, field, forest, etc.) manually
3) enter some descriptive data about the tile like - name, short description, notes

**Medium priority** features:
1) edit and select tile subtype - city, port, village, ruins, etc manually

**Low priority** features:
1) starting on a blank or randomly generated map
3) export & import functionality
4) authentication system
5) DM and Player division system
6) movable tokens
7) random generation settings
8) create, edit, delete tile types
9) change tile type images by importing your own
